# Path of curiosity.

As we grow older we acquire knowledge - some of it useful, some bound to be someday.

## Do we choose what interests us?

To be alive is to feel.  
Senses are stitched to being; even if they vanish, something still feels.  
Can it?  
What does "alive" mean without any outside signal?  
What makes a person develop taste, opinions, interests?  
Outside influence is there, yes - but what decides which moments stay?  
Coincidence, maybe?  
Call it chance if you like, yet it newer feels random.

## Why so curious?

To answer exactly why we are curious beings, will decrease total number of questions to be asked.  
I feel that we ask questions so we might unlock some more.
It is a never-ending play.  
Some play to win, some to win or lose, some to laugh.  
The whole world is at play; some rules apply, but no rule is set yet.

## History of cooperation

We live in gentle explosion: information flows, cooperation swells.  
Think food we eat, clothes we wear, roofs overhead many, many hands.  
Do we truly grasp the human hours baked into one building, from first sketch, through permits, trucks, beams, paint?  
A car, a phone, the invisible netâ€”effort beyond imagination.  
Our minds cannot stretch that far.  
When we pass on information, materials, care, nudge the next traveler toward the open lane; whisper about the dead ends.  
Done with attention, the total mistakes shrink.  
The system I somehow joined may yet resist entropy a little longer.

## What is source of randomness

Not knowing.

## Now I am going to sleep.

Thank you for sticking this far.  
Many will find this material dense and kind of pointless.  
That is simply a symptom of consuming too much information.
