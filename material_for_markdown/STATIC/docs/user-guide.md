# Path of curiosity.

As we grow older we acuire knowledge, some of it one could consider useful or bound to be someday.

## Do we choose what interests us?

To be alive also mean to feel. Our senses are attached to our being, meaning that one can feel even if senses themself are absent. Can they? What it even means to be alive without some kind of input from outside?   
What causes any kind of human being to develop taste, opinions interests? Even if we assume outside influence is at play, what determines which experiences will stuck with us? Coincidence perhaps? And yet none of us feel that way?

## Why so curious? 

To answer exactly why we are courious being will mean we have one less thing worry about. That is beside the point. I feel that we ask questions just to spawn more questions to ask. Its neverending play. Some play to win, some play to win or lose, some play to laugh. The whole world is at play, some rules apply but no rule is set yet.

## History of cooperation

We live in beautiful times, informations flow, cooperation grows. Thinking about it...from food that we eat, clothes that we put on, shelter that we inhabit. Many, many hands created those blessings. Do we really understand how much human effort has been put into a buildings that we visit, from the planning, approving, sourcing materials until building it. From a car that we drive...celphone...internet...incomprehensible amount of human effort is put into everything we touch and see. Our minds are not capable of streching that faar. When passing on informations, materials to for others well being, kindly nudge them into right direction. Warn them about dead ends ahead. I feel that by doing it with right care and consciousness total numbers of mistakes will decrease. So this system that i have somehow got integrated into will not fall victim to entropy law.

## What is source of randomness

Not knowing.

## Now i am going to sleep.

Thank you for sticking this faar. Many will find this material dense and kind of pointless. And that is simply symptom of consuming too much information.
